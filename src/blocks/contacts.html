						Once I got carried away electronics, and then the arduino platform. This was my first experience in programming it turned out very interesting. After I had created several small projects I realized that I liked programming  so much and I wanted to study it more. So I began to study frontend and it became my hobby. The more I studied the more I understood  that my hobby  has to become my job.
